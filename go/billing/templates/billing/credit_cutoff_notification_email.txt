Hi {{user.get_full_name}}!

Please note that your Vumi Go account ({{account.user.email}}) has reached {{threshold_percent}}% used of the total available credits. Your remaining balance is {{credit_balance}} credits. This means that you will no longer be able to send any more messages, and all session based transport requests will be terminated with a message indicating that the account has run out of credits. All incoming messages will be received as normal, and you will still be charged for them.

To top up your credits contact your Praekelt programme manager with the number of messages/sessions you want loaded. Once you have loaded enough credits, all messages will be sent and received as normal.


Regards,

The Vumi Go Team.
